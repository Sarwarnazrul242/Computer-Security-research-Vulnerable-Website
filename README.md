# Vulnerable Web Application for Security Research

- Introduction
This project hosts a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for security research and testing purposes. It aims to provide a realistic environment to test and evaluate web application firewalls (WAFs) against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL Injection attacks.

- Purpose
The primary goal of this website is to serve as a testbed for Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection capabilities. It allows researchers and security enthusiasts to:
-- Understand the behavior of XSS and SQL Injection attacks in a controlled environment.
-- Test and improve WAF configurations and rules.
-- Develop and refine attack detection and prevention strategies.
- Warning
This website is intentionally insecure and should not be hosted on a public network. It is designed exclusively for educational and research purposes.

- Features
XSS Vulnerability: Includes various inputs and parameters vulnerable to XSS attacks.
SQL Injection Vulnerability: Contains SQL injection points for testing injection techniques.
Logging Mechanism: Records attack patterns and WAF responses for analysis.
